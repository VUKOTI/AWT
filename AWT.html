      The life and glories of Raghu are described in the poem Raghuvamsha,
      written by Kalidasa. In the third canto, his birth, education, and
      marriage are described. He participates in the hundredth ashvamedha
      sacrifice of his father, fighting Indra, who steals the sacrificial horse.
      His victory against the deity is followed by his ascension to the throne,
      after Dilipa retires to the forest. In the fourth canto, Raghu expands his
      domains, subjugating the kings of Vanga, Utkala, Kalinga, the Pandya king,
      Huns, Persians, and Pragjyotisha.
